I will make better info threads later, but here I attach the two main SH2 asm files that I've been working on and commenting to make them as universal as possbile.

The first file is hooked into the MUT processing routine, it grabs requests E0,E1,E2 and setups up a 6 byte DMA transfer that has a 4 byte address and 2 byte length.

The second file uses DMA end and transmit end interrupts to setup a further DMA transfer to/from the 4 byte address of the 2 byte length. It uses flags to clean up afterwards.

A third file I've not put here yet runs off the main ECU loop to kill DMA and reset our flags if the comms timeout.

Example:

E0 ... wait 10ms .... 00035920 0040 will then have the ECU dump 64 (40) bytes from the addresses pointed to by 35920, 35924, 35928 etc (DMA logging)

E1 ... wait 10ms .... FFFF8500 00FF will then have the ECU dump 255 (FF) bytes from FFFF8500 in ECU RAM.

E2 ... wait 10ms .... FFFF8500 00FF followed by 255 (FF) bytes will get the ECU to write these bytes at FFFF8500 in ECU RAM.
